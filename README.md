## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with about ~12 years of experience, currently focusing on cross-platform application development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [Piktosaur](https://github.com/Bloomca/Piktosaur) -- WinUI 3 photo gallery application
  - [Streakosaur](https://github.com/Bloomca/Streakosaur) -- SwiftUI application to manage streaks
 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
   - low-level OS concepts (C, like this [Win32 app](https://github.com/Bloomca/win32-pomodoro-timer), and [TUI editor](https://github.com/Bloomca/love) in Rust)
   - how to parse audio CDs ([library](https://github.com/Bloomca/rust-cd-da-reader), [blog post](https://blog.bloomca.me/2025/08/31/how-to-read-audio-cd)) and play audio to build a [ripper](https://github.com/Bloomca/audio-cd-ripper) + player apps
