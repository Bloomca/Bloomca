## Hi there 👋

I’m a senior software developer who builds user-facing software across web and cross-platform desktop, and I enjoy working on messy, hard problems—sync, offline state, performance, and OS integrations.

My recent projects:

- [Piktosaur](https://github.com/Bloomca/Piktosaur) -- WinUI 3 photo gallery application
- [rust-cd-da-reader](https://github.com/Bloomca/rust-cd-da-reader) -- Rust crate to read ToC and raw audio from Audio CDs (+ [CLI ripper app](https://github.com/Bloomca/audio-cd-ripper))
- [Veles](https://github.com/Bloomca/veles) -- UI library with atomic DOM updates, focused on performance
- [Better image download](https://github.com/Bloomca/better-image-download) -- browser extension to download images in bulk

I am a fan of open source and develop all my projects in public!
