## Hi there 👋

I’m a senior software developer who builds user-facing software across web and cross-platform desktop with solid backend knowledge, and I enjoy working on messy, hard problems—sync, offline state, performance, and OS integrations.

My recent projects:

- [Piktosaur](https://github.com/Bloomca/Piktosaur) -- WinUI 3 photo gallery application
- Audio stack:
  - [cd-da-reader](https://github.com/Bloomca/rust-cd-da-reader) -- Rust crate to read ToC and raw audio from Audio CDs
  - [CLI ripper app](https://github.com/Bloomca/audio-cd-ripper) -- CLI application to rip audio CD data, convert it to flac and fetch metadata
  - [TUI audio CD player](https://github.com/Bloomca/rust-cd-audio-player) -- TUI application to play audio CD from your terminal
  - [Discosaur](https://github.com/Bloomca/Discosaur) -- WinUI3 music player application
- [Veles](https://github.com/Bloomca/veles) -- UI library with atomic DOM updates, focused on performance

I am a fan of open source and develop all my projects in public!
